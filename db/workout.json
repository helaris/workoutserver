I would speak to clients and explain that all they needed was 30-60 minutes at the gym 4-5 times a week. This would give them the results they were looking for. How can this be so difficult? Aren’t your fitness goals important to you? Many would say yes, but then proceed to list the reason they were not able to get to the gym.I found that for many of these people, their busy schedules, family time, traveling and/or the distance they lived from a gym were the main reasons they didn’t work out. Getting back and forth from the gym cost them time and changing at the gym was a hassle. During the first half of the year, when they were most motivated, gyms were swamped.",

But, like millions of people around the globe, our lives have evolved over the course of the last month due to a pandemic and an order encouraging us to “stay at home.”After only a week of social distancing, I was greeted by a string of words I never dreamed of hearing: “Can you help me with a workout?” Although it was music to my ears, it also presented a challenge: it had to be simple enough to do at home, but demanding enough to catalyze results. And as if that wasn’t enough, she asked if I’d do them with her — I can’t go to the gym, after all. Now, these workouts had to be strenuous enough to make me sweat. Challenge accepted.I started with a few guiding principles: working with time instead of reps will increase intensity where we couldn’t use weights, and specifying rest time between sets would hold us accountable for keeping our heart-rates up. The duration of each exercise can be increased in increments of 10 seconds as the movements become easier, and the length of each rest should be decreased by increments of 5 seconds as you acclimate to the demands of each workout.
